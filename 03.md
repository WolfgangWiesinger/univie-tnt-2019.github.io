# Goals
CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-CHANGES!
Learning about version control systems and how they help in the development of  DH project, which are often a lengthy and complex, and require organic collaboration. 

# Software & Other Required Materials

* Make sure to create a github account (<https://github.com/>), if you do not have one.
* Download and install `git` software:
	* for Windows:
		* you can download it from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>. Please, choose **64-bit Git for Windows Setup**.
		* you can also install a portable version of `git` from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>. Please, chose **64-bit Git for Windows Portable**. Simply download and unzip (*Suggestion*: move that unzipped folder to the folder where you keep all class-related files and materials).
	* for Mac: try to run `git --version` from Terminal. If `git` is not installed, you will be prompted to install `Xcode Command Line Tools` which comes with `git` among other things. This is the easiest way.

# In Class

* Basic `git` functionality;
* Starting a `github`-based website;
* Basics of `markdown`;

## General `git` workflow:

* *In `Terminal` (on Mac) or `Git-Bash` (on Windows)*
	* `fork` a repository
	* `clone`
	* *work*
	* `add`
	* `commit`
	* `push` / `pull`
	* send `pull request`

## Main `git` Commands

* `git clone <link>`
	- clones/downloads a repository on you machine
* `git status`
	- shows the current status of the repository (new, changed, deleted)
* `git add .`
	- adds all new files and modified files to the repository
* `git commit -m "message"`
	- saves all files in their current state into the repository, and created a milestone
* `git push origin master`
	- uploads changes to [github.com](https://github.com/)
	- **NB:** sometimes you may get an error, which in most cases means that you need to `pull` first
* `git pull origin master`
	- downloads changes from [github.com](https://github.com/)
* `git log`
	- shows the history of `commit`s; here you can choose where you want to roll back, in case of troubles

## Some useful command line commands

* `pwd`
	- shows you where you are on a drive (gives you path)
* `ls` / `dir` [on Windows]
	- shows everything in the your current location/folder
* `cd <name of the folder>`
	- takes you to that folder
* `cd ..` 
	- takes you one level up in the tree structure of your computer

# Homework

* Build your website on <github.com>.
	* You can use this template <https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll> (the page also includes step-by-step instructions; our course website is built with this theme).
		* You are encouraged to use other themes as well. Check, for example, <https://jekyllthemes.io/> or <http://jekyllthemes.org/>. Or, ask Google. 
	* Brief instructions (more details can be found in Visconti's tutorial (see above), and on the page of the suggested template)
		* `fork`
		* create a repository under your account with the name: `username.github.io`, where username is your github username; the repository with such names are automatically treated by github as a website.
		* copy all files from the forked repository into your new one (`clone` > `copy/paste`)
		* README.md has all the instructions on how to make modifications to your site; play with those!
		* you can pick a different theme for you site (just google `jekyll themes` for options)
* Complete Codecademy’s *Learn Git* [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git);
	- if you’d like more practice, there is another one: [https://try.github.io](https://try.github.io) 
* Publish your confirmation screenshot as a post on your new site;
* Complete the markdown tutorial @ [https://www.markdowntutorial.com/](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). This will help you to write pages on your website
